    <h1 class="center-title">My AutobiographyüçÇ</h1>

      <p>·¢âê≠© My name is Elaizza Mae Bensi.   I was born on May 15, 2002, in Babag 2, Lapu-Lapu City, and I am currently studying Bachelor of Industrial Technology major in Computer Technology at Lapu-Lapu City College. 
      I chose this course because I've always been interested in computers and how technology works in our daily lives. Ever since I was young, I loved exploring gadgets and learning new things about technology. 
      This passion inspired me to take a program that would help me build skills I can use in the future. 
      Studying Computer Technology has been both challenging and exciting for me because it allows me to learn through hands-on experiences.</p>
      
      <p>As a student, I always do my best to understand every lesson and apply what I learn in real-life situations. 
      I believe that every challenge I face helps me grow and become better. My teachers and classmates have also played a big part in motivating me to keep improving. 
      I've learned that success doesn't come easy, it takes patience, hard work, and consistency. 
      Every day in college is another step toward my dream of building a career in the field of technology.</p>
      
      <p>I am the youngest daughter in my family, and that role has taught me a lot about responsibility and independence. 
      My family has always been my inspiration to do well and stay strong no matter what happens. 
      They support me in every decision I make and guide me whenever I need help. 
      I'm very thankful for them because they've shaped me into who I am today.</p>
        
      <p>During my free time, I love reading books and watching movies to relax my mind. 
      I also enjoy playing badminton because it helps me stay active and competitive. 
      Riding motorcycles and cars is another thing I love, it gives me a sense of freedom and excitement. 
      These hobbies make me happy and help me balance my academic and personal life.</p>

      <p>My favorite colors are sage green, mustard yellow, black, and white because they represent my personality; calm, warm, strong, and simple. 
      I believe that being yourself is the best way to achieve happiness and success. 
      As I continue my journey in college, I want to keep learning, growing, and achieving my goals. 
      I dream of using my knowledge in Computer Technology to build a meaningful career. 
      Most of all, I want to make my family proud and become an inspiration to others through hard work and dedication. ·¢âê≠©</p>
